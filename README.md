# OG-Steam-Library
Library theme for use with <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/OG-Steam">OG-Steam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SteamFriendsPatcher">SteamFriendsPatcher<a>. A lot of unnecessary padding as been removed to free up screen real estate. Transitions and gradients have also been removed.

Update: Live version now available <a href="https://ungstein.github.io/og-steam-library/og-steam-library-live.zip">here!</a>
This version loads up-to-date files live from GitHub; no files are saved to your computer. If the live version does not appear to be updating, please try deleting Steam's browser cache under Settings > Web Browser.

Installing
-

* Make sure SteamFriendsPatcher.exe is running.
* Make sure Steam Beta is checked in SteamFriendsPatcher Settings.
* Copy the **steamui** folder into your Steam installation folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam").
* Optional webkit.css can be placed in skins\OG-Steam\resource to remove additional fluff such as What's New, Ratings, Add to Activity Feed and Trading Cards.
