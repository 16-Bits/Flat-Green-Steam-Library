# OG-Steam-Library
Library theme adapted from <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/OG-Steam-Library">OG-Steam-Library</a> for use with <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/Flat-Green-Steam">Flat-Green-Steam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SteamFriendsPatcher">SteamFriendsPatcher<a>. Not a faithful reproduction of the 2009 Steam Library GUI, just an edit of the original <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/OG-Steam-Library">OG-Steam-Library</a> theme so that the Steam Library GUI of <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/Flat-Green-Steam">Flat-Green-Steam</a> stands out less.

Installing
-

* Make sure SteamFriendsPatcher.exe is running.
* Make sure Steam Beta is checked in SteamFriendsPatcher Settings.
* Copy the **steamui** folder into your Steam installation folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam").

Uninstalling
-

* Make sure SteamFriendsPatcher is not set to run on startup (Settings > uncheck "Start with Windows")
* Delete the **steamui** folder, then restart Steam. This will force Steam to download an extract the current Steam package, giving you the original Library files.
